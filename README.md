~~There are still some unknown bugs with the pictures with sign of "85010200"(HEX), while "A5010200"(HEX) appears normal.~~ I give up. There are many **same pictures with same file name and same content** in the archive, which may mean that there is meaningless content in it. Those unreadable pictures may should not exist at all.
